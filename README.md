# Shopping List

There was a [post on Reddit about an antique pocket shopping list](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/jxfsfv/an_antique_pocket_shopping_list/) on "r/interestingasfuck".

An antique pocket shopping list is a board with fixed items/groceries and switches for each item so you can mark them for shopping.

I liked the idea so I built it as web app very quickly just for fun.
